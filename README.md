# Patch 1.0 created by Jakub Kwidzi≈Ñski and Jeremi Rycharski on November 23, 2021.

*Corrections in the code were introduced based on SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java.*

- The following rules were applied in the code:

  - NUM07-J. Do not attempt comparisons with NaN
  
  - NUM02-J. Ensure that division and remainder operations do not result in divide-by-zero errors

  - NUM12-J. Ensure conversions of numeric types to narrower types do not result in lost or misinterpreted data
